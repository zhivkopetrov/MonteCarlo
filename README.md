# MonteCarlo
Visualization for Monte Carlo algorithm

To manually make your code use the -std=c++11 compiler flag.

For the graphics part I am using a 2D C++ graphical tool called SFML.
You can donwload it and find out how to install it for your OS on this link http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/
